       The Filipino Pancit Palabok is one of the most popular dishes in the Philippines. It has a luscious and robust sauce that presents a depth of taste, beginning with a foundation of chicken and shrimp broth, then enriched by fish sauce, the essence extracted from shrimp shells and heads, and tender flakes of smoked fish. This medley is generously poured over resilient rice noodles and crowned with roasted pork belly, shrimp, boiled eggs, and an array of embellishments like crispy fried garlic, crumbled fried pork skins, scallions, and citrus wedges.
